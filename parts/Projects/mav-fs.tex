    \item Led a team of 4 to build a command-line-interfaced index-allocated file system for a class project.
    %\item Designed the command parsing and running sytems by prioritizing scalability.
    \item Implemented commands such as \verb|readfile|, which reads a file from disk into the file system, and \verb|list|, which lists all the files in the file system.
